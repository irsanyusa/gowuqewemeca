Her mother, Tish, hinted that she’s working on&nbsp;her next album. Despite Miley’s past aversion to&nbsp;touring and performing for large crowds, could she make an&nbsp;exception for the Super Bowl halftime show? <strong>Fans are hopeful, especially given Miley’s track record of&nbsp;delivering electrifying performances.</strong> Only time will tell if&nbsp;she’ll grace the Super Bowl stage in&nbsp;2025, but the excitement and speculation continue to&nbsp;grow.</p><p><h2>Prediction three: Taylor Swift</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e23/ac4/94db0254029c16dd2752a42bb5.jpg><p>Casey Flanigan/imageSPACE/Associated Press/East News</p><p>No&nbsp;conversation about the Super Bowl halftime show would be&nbsp;complete without mentioning <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. <strong>Taylor gained </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>attention</strong></a><strong> during the 2023/24&nbsp;NFL season due to&nbsp;her relationship with </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;the Kansas City Chiefs.</strong> Many believe she could make an&nbsp;even bigger impact by&nbsp;headlining her own halftime show.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Sportsbookreview</strong></a><strong> lists Taylor as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the early favorites for the 2025&nbsp;show.</strong> Despite reportedly declining the opportunity in&nbsp;the past, citing a&nbsp;“long-term partnership” with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Coca-Cola</a>, 2025 could be&nbsp;the right time for Taylor to&nbsp;shine.

Her concerns may include missing out if&nbsp;Travis Kelce and the Chiefs reach the 2025 Super Bowl.</p><p><strong>With Taylor’s announcement of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new album, </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i><strong>The Tortured Poets Department</strong></i></a><strong>, scheduled for release on&nbsp;April&nbsp;19, 2024, she may be&nbsp;preoccupied with planning a&nbsp;tour for the record early next year. </strong>Despite this, Taylor still holds odds of&nbsp;+200 to&nbsp;headline the halftime show, showcasing her immense star power.</p><p>Taylor’s relationship with Kelce has reportedly elevated the NFL and the Chiefs’ brand, particularly among young women, leading to&nbsp;increased sales of&nbsp;Kelce’s replica jerseys. Should Taylor headline a&nbsp;halftime show in&nbsp;the near future, it’s expected to&nbsp;further enhance the NFL’s popularity.</p><p><h2>Prediction four: Drake</h2></p><p>When discussing potential Super Bowl <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>headliners</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Drake</a>, a&nbsp;frequent collaborator and former mentee of&nbsp;Lil Wayne, often enters the conversation. <strong>He’s also listed on&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Sportsbookreview’s</strong></a><strong> odds lists, but there hasn’t been any indication or&nbsp;confirmation that he’s been approached to&nbsp;headline.</strong></p><p>Drake would undoubtedly be&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong choice, given his immense popularity as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the biggest artists globally. However, whether he’ll headline in&nbsp;2025&nbsp;is uncertain.<strong> If&nbsp;Lil Wayne were to&nbsp;headline, there’s a&nbsp;possibility that Drake could join him on&nbsp;stage as&nbsp;a&nbsp;guest performer. </strong>Drake’s massive fan base and chart-topping hits make him a&nbsp;compelling candidate for the halftime show. His dynamic stage presence and ability to&nbsp;engage audiences could make for a&nbsp;memorable performance.</p><p>While rumors and speculations continue to&nbsp;swirl, only time will tell who will ultimately take the spotlight at&nbsp;the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show. Fans eagerly await any announcements or&nbsp;developments regarding the lineup for the highly anticipated event.</p><p><h2>Prediction&nbsp;5: Billie Eilish</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Billie Eilish</a> made a&nbsp;big splash at&nbsp;the recent Grammy Awards, clinching the Song of&nbsp;the Year award for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>What Was I&nbsp;Made For?</i></a> This win not only marked a&nbsp;triumph for Billie but also prevented Taylor from securing her first Song of&nbsp;the Year Grammy. <strong>Now, the question arises: could Billie also steal the spotlight from Taylor by&nbsp;headlining the Super Bowl halftime show next year?</strong></p><p>According to&nbsp;the best <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>betting apps</a>, Billie stands as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the favorites, to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;the halftime performance. <strong>Following closely behind is&nbsp;London-born artist </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Dua Lipa</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Both artists have the talent to&nbsp;shine on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;America’s grandest stages. <strong>Similarly, Brits </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Ed&nbsp;Sheeran</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a><strong> could also captivate audiences with their performances.

However, a&nbsp;few critical errors and key injuries swung the game in&nbsp;Kansas City’s favor. Nevertheless, the 49ers remain confident in&nbsp;their ability to&nbsp;clinch the NFC title once again and secure their first Super Bowl victory since 1994.<br>Although their defense was formidable last season, the loss of&nbsp;Pro-Bowl linebacker Dre Greenlaw to&nbsp;an&nbsp;Achilles injury during the Super Bowl leaves them potentially understaffed for the upcoming season. Despite this setback, the 49ers are determined to&nbsp;overcome the odds and reclaim their position as&nbsp;champions. With a&nbsp;solid lineup and strong determination, they aim to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;triumphant return to&nbsp;the Super Bowl stage. Fans eagerly anticipate their performance in&nbsp;the upcoming season and hope to&nbsp;see them emerge victorious in&nbsp;the ultimate showdown.</li><li><strong>Another possible </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>prediction</strong></a><strong>: Chiefs.</strong> Kansas City’s performance last season showed they’re a&nbsp;team to&nbsp;watch. Despite some rough patches in&nbsp;the regular season, the combination of&nbsp;Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes always comes through in&nbsp;the end. Both Reid and Mahomes will be&nbsp;back next season, along with defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, who’s proving himself as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best defensive coaches ever. With or&nbsp;without changes in&nbsp;free agency, their defense should be&nbsp;strong.<br>And if&nbsp;they upgrade their receivers, imagine how potent their offense could&nbsp;be. Even when the Chiefs struggled during the 2023&nbsp;NFL season, their odds of&nbsp;winning the championship hardly budged on&nbsp;our best sports betting apps. Betting on&nbsp;them early might pay off, considering the odds could get even shorter as&nbsp;the season progresses.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/648/54f/46067d5490b0973964fd645b80.jpg><ul><li><strong>The Bengals </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>made</strong></a><strong> it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the AFC Championship twice in&nbsp;the last three seasons. </strong>In&nbsp;2021-22, they came close to&nbsp;winning the Super Bowl despite having one of&nbsp;the weakest offensive lines seen in&nbsp;recent times for a&nbsp;title contender. This shows how exceptional Joe Burrow is&nbsp;and how he’s improved his team over the years.<br>However, the issues with protection finally caught up&nbsp;to&nbsp;Burrow this season, and his injury was perhaps the main reason the Bengals didn’t make a&nbsp;serious run for the 2024 Super Bowl. With nearly $70 million available, the team can now focus on&nbsp;rebuilding the leaky offensive line and bolstering their defense, which is&nbsp;still under the guidance of&nbsp;top coordinator Lou Anarumo.</li><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Atlanta Falcons</strong></a><strong> are not being forgotten.</strong> They’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;weak NFC South, and if&nbsp;they find a&nbsp;good quarterback, they could make a&nbsp;run for the Super Bowl. Rumors suggest Russell Wilson might join them, but whoever it&nbsp;is, any improvement will boost the Falcons in&nbsp;the NFC rankings. They have a&nbsp;strong offense with Bijan Robinson, Kyle Pitts, and Drake London, but they need a&nbsp;better quarterback to&nbsp;make the most of&nbsp;it.<br>Defensively, they need to&nbsp;fill some gaps, especially in&nbsp;the secondary, but their big defensive line puts pressure on&nbsp;opposing quarterbacks. The Falcons will need things to&nbsp;go&nbsp;right to&nbsp;reach the playoffs, but with +4000&nbsp;odds, they’re worth considering. If&nbsp;they get a&nbsp;new quarterback, their odds could drop to&nbsp;+2000, so&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;good long-term bet.

Once again, their defense was excellent, but their offense fell short in&nbsp;the AFC Championship game. While Jackson isn’t solely to&nbsp;blame, as&nbsp;the team’s leader, he&nbsp;must shoulder some responsibility for the mistakes made. As&nbsp;they head into the 2024-25&nbsp;season, the Ravens have a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;prove.<br>Despite Jackson’s MVP status, his postseason performance hasn’t inspired much confidence. They’re starting to&nbsp;resemble the Cowboys, who perform well in&nbsp;the regular season but falter in&nbsp;January. If&nbsp;the Ravens were at&nbsp;+900 odds to&nbsp;have the best regular season record, I’d bet on&nbsp;them. However, I&nbsp;can’t trust Jackson and the Ravens in&nbsp;the postseason at&nbsp;this price. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;tough AFC, they’re an&nbsp;easy choice to&nbsp;avoid. While their defense will win them some games, I&nbsp;don’t have enough faith in&nbsp;their offense to&nbsp;place a&nbsp;bet, especially when facing strong defensive opponents.</li></ul><p>Predictions are always fun to&nbsp;make!
