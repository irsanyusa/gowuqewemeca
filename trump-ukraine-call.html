border-l-2 border-solid border-time-red text-5xl py-2 pr-0.5 pl-[0.3125rem] my-0.5 mr-2.5 font-zilla-slab">T</span>he White House on Wednesday released its summary of a July phone call between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart that has triggered fresh calls for an impeachment inquiry from the highest echelons of Congressional Democratic leadership.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The summary, which is a not a “verbatim transcript” but rather a collection of “notes and recollections” from staffers listening to the call, comes after a whistleblower in the U.S. intelligence community filed a complaint in August regarding the leaders’ conversation. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>reports</a>, the whistleblower was concerned that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President and current Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden. Trump and others in his orbit have alleged without evidence that, while he was Vice President, Joe Biden blocked Ukrainian officials from investigating his son Hunter Biden’s business activities in the country. The Washington Post has <a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a> that, ahead of the call, Trump <a href=# rel=noopener>told his Administration to withhold</a> $400 million in military aid for Ukraine, which is fighting a separatist movement in the country’s east.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the House would launch a formal impeachment inquiry regarding Trump’s actions. The move marked a reversal for Pelosi, who had been reluctant to embrace an impeachment inquiry despite the vociferous support of several prominent progressive Democrats. “This week, the President has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,” Pelosi said. “The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of the President’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.” While a major political movement, Pelosi’s move merely put her imprimatur on an investigation that was already underway.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump has confirmed speaking to Zelensky about Biden, but denied pressuring the Ukrainian leader by threatening to deny his country aid. Speaking to reporters before he addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump said that he would provide a “read out” of the call.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The release of the White House summary is unlikely to quell Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, many of whom are demanding to see the whistleblower’s original report. The whistleblower him or herself may soon testify before lawmakers as well; House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff said Tuesday that the whistleblower’s counsel has expressed their client’s interest in testifying before the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Below is the White House’s summary of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>MEMORANDUM OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">PARTICIPANTS: President Zelenskyy of Ukraine</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Notetakers: The White House Situation Room</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DATE, TIME AND PLACE: July 25, 2019, 9:03 – 9:33 a.m. EDT Residence</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">CAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation. The word “inaudible” is used to indicate portions of a conversation that the notetaker was unable to hear.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind – somebody who wasn’t given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It’s a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I’m able to tell you the following; the first time, you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> [laughter] That’s a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it’s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it’s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russia Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps, specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation … I think you are surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you said yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly. That I can assure you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President: </b>Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I’m knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament; the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> Well, she’s going to go through some things I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It’s a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> I would like to tell you that I also have.quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also wanted to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities· and get to know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for your support.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we’ll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> Thank you very much. I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> Okay, we can work that out. I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy</b>: Thank you very much Mr. President.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>The President:</b> Congratulations on a fantastic job you’ve done. The whole world was watching. I’m not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>President Zelenskyy:</b> Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">— End of Conversation —</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubmhqhnWDjq2prqWgYsKsvsCipZ5lk5a5rXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dr-90210-reality-doctor-robert-rey-punches-a-guy-for-grabbing-his-manhood.html>&#171;&nbsp;Reality doctor, Robert Rey punches a guy for grabbing his manhood</a>
