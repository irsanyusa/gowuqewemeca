I’m going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, but I’m also not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disrespectful to&nbsp;anyone that was involved.»</p><p>Reesa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> her ex-husband, whom she calls Legion, in&nbsp;March 2020. They found each other <strong>on&nbsp;two dating websites, where he&nbsp;used different names</strong>. Reesa noticed this and felt it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;warning sign.</p><p>During their first phone call, Legion <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> her he&nbsp;had moved from <a href=# title=California data-link=tag>California</a> to&nbsp;Georgia for a&nbsp;new job. <strong>He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;regional manager at&nbsp;a&nbsp;major condiment company</strong>. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;Philadelphia and after graduating, he&nbsp;stayed on&nbsp;the West Coast, where he&nbsp;married a&nbsp;woman with two children.</p><p>He&nbsp;told Reesa that he&nbsp;caught his wife cheating, leading to&nbsp;their divorce, but he&nbsp;remained close to&nbsp;his ex-stepchildren. He&nbsp;also mentioned playing something called «Arena Football,» which Reesa wasn’t familiar with. Additionally, he&nbsp;claimed to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;an&nbsp;IT guy at&nbsp;<a href=# title=Apple data-link=tag>Apple</a> during his off-seasons.</p><p>Their first date almost <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>didn’t happen</a> because Reesa got a&nbsp;flat tire on&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;dinner. But <strong>Legion came to&nbsp;her rescue</strong>, fixing her tire and buying her a&nbsp;new one. At&nbsp;dinner, they talked about their shared dreams of&nbsp;marriage and starting a&nbsp;family.<strong> Legion said all the right things to&nbsp;make Reesa feel special. </strong>«The person&nbsp;I met was very funny, was personable,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>. «This was a&nbsp;guy who I&nbsp;really, after having multiple conversations with, felt like, ’Wow, where have you been?’»</p><p><h2>Moving together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96f/d88/8148b958e6b98a309f2a6138a5.jpg><p>Within <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>two weeks</a> after their meeting, Reesa and Legion, who had become very close, decided to&nbsp;move together.</p><p>They picked Reesa’s three-bedroom rental over the small studio apartment Legion’s job provided. Although they weren’t married, Legion covered all of&nbsp;Reesa’s rent and bills. «<strong>He&nbsp;was paying all the bills, and he&nbsp;was being, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;called, ’a provider,’ and&nbsp;I had never in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life experienced that before</strong>,» Reesa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>.</p><p>Reesa, due to&nbsp;her beliefs, felt uneasy about living together without being married. But the financial help was too tempting to&nbsp;resist.</p><p>«This isn’t going to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;look good, but it’s the truth. It&nbsp;was intoxicating to&nbsp;not have to&nbsp;worry about how to&nbsp;pay the bills. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;wonderful feeling. And I&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;pushed to&nbsp;the side that you’re shacking&nbsp;up, but you don’t have to&nbsp;worry right now,» Reesa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><p><h2>First broken promises.</h2></p><p>The <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> sped ahead, and <strong>after three months of&nbsp;dating, the couple were engaged and expecting a&nbsp;<a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a></strong>. But soon, Legion started making promises to&nbsp;Reesa and then breaking them.</p><p>It&nbsp;began with house hunting. Legion <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claimed</a> he&nbsp;was financially stable from his past career in&nbsp;Arena football, saying he&nbsp;could afford a&nbsp;$750,000 mortgage and make cash offers on&nbsp;houses. He&nbsp;even promised to&nbsp;buy Reesa her dream car, a&nbsp;BMW X5&nbsp;with a&nbsp;special interior, but it&nbsp;never happened.</p><p>Every house he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;buy fell through, despite seemingly perfect conditions. «Most women in&nbsp;their right mind would have been, like, ’I’m out’. And I&nbsp;didn’t,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;turn a&nbsp;blind eye to&nbsp;lies. <strong>Reesa started to&nbsp;feel suspicious and started keeping an&nbsp;audio diary to&nbsp;track her concerns.</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;week after losing out on&nbsp;their first potential family home, <strong>Reesa had a&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>miscarriage</strong></a><strong> and needed <a href=# title=surgery data-link=tag>surgery</a></strong>. Instead of&nbsp;taking her to&nbsp;the hospital, Legion prioritized an&nbsp;alleged business meeting about his promotion to&nbsp;CEO.</p><p>In&nbsp;the fall of&nbsp;2020, <strong>Reesa thought her husband had been </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>promoted</strong></a><strong> to&nbsp;CEO at&nbsp;his company</strong>. However, despite this, <strong>he&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;wear T-shirts to&nbsp;work</strong>, claiming he&nbsp;was always on&nbsp;the production floor. They tried to&nbsp;buy three more houses, but each deal fell through. In&nbsp;one instance, Legion made a&nbsp;big cash bid, but the sellers asked for proof of&nbsp;funds, causing a&nbsp;deadlock. <strong>Their real estate agent, Scott, said he&nbsp;couldn’t continue working with them until they provided proof of&nbsp;funds</strong> to&nbsp;his agency.</p><p>She also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> to&nbsp;ignoring these warning signs for three reasons: she feared being alone, she was concerned about the appearance of&nbsp;a&nbsp;short-lived relationship, and she was eager to&nbsp;get married.</p><p><h2>Reesa and Legion got married in&nbsp;January 2021.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4aa/4b5/36ad1d509686133afedbeb5f97.jpg><p>Legion and Reesa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;pause their search for both a&nbsp;house and a&nbsp;car and got married in&nbsp;January 2021. But by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;that month, Reesa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>felt</a> something was wrong, «I&nbsp;kinda knew&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;trouble.» She memorized her new husband’s social security number from the marriage certificate and ran a&nbsp;background check, finding nothing.</p><p><strong>Legion </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>started</strong></a><strong> making strange claims, saying their neighbor was hitting on&nbsp;him</strong>. <strong>He&nbsp;began coming home later than usual</strong>, around six or&nbsp;seven, after always being back by&nbsp;4&nbsp;p.m. for nearly a&nbsp;year. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was looking at&nbsp;houses again with his friend, who coincidentally was also named Scott.</p><p>Once, <strong>he&nbsp;made up&nbsp;a&nbsp;story about Reesa’s ex&nbsp;visiting their house</strong>, looking for her. During a&nbsp;dinner date, he&nbsp;pointed out a&nbsp;building his company supposedly bought, but when Reesa asked to&nbsp;see his office, he&nbsp;claimed it&nbsp;was closed and his badge wouldn’t work after a&nbsp;call to&nbsp;the security guard.</p><p>In&nbsp;April, after Reesa discovered Facebook messages of&nbsp;<strong>Legion flirting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very free manner with </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>seven</strong></a><strong> other women, they began couple’s counseling</strong>. After a&nbsp;fight about Legion’s secret bank account during a&nbsp;session, the counselor suggested that their<i> </i>marriage would not last long.</p><p>Despite this, Reesa and Legion didn’t consider separating. Instead, they resumed house-hunting, this time with a&nbsp;realtor named Amber. When Amber requested proof of&nbsp;funds as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the usual pre-approval process, Reesa decided to&nbsp;step back from the search.</p><p><h2>The truth started coming out.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/066/48e/720908549c8fe5933315315b8c.jpg><p>By&nbsp;late April, Reesa began <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seeking</a> a&nbsp;new job in&nbsp;hopes of&nbsp;earning more money to&nbsp;pay off her car without relying on&nbsp;Legion. During the application process for one job, she had to&nbsp;fill out a&nbsp;background check form, including details about her spouse. This time, the number he&nbsp;gave matched reality. Another background check revealed the truth: <strong>Legion had fabricated his entire past.</strong></p><p>For more than a&nbsp;year, <strong>Legion had been </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>pretending</strong></a><strong> to&nbsp;have daily conversations with his family, friends, and colleagues</strong>. Additionally, he&nbsp;wasn’t actually a&nbsp;vice president at&nbsp;a&nbsp;condiment company, <strong>he&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>worked</strong></a><strong> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;temporary forklift driver</strong>.</p><p>He&nbsp;hadn’t lived in&nbsp;California, never played pro football, and when she contacted the school, they had no&nbsp;records of&nbsp;his Social Security number. When Reesa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confronted</a> Legion, he&nbsp;claimed his father had arranged for him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;«private citizen,» so&nbsp;the school didn’t record his information. Around the same time, he&nbsp;told Reesa that his ex-stepdaughter had died suddenly, and he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;send his ex-wife $2,000 for the funeral.</p><p>Turned out his ex-wife was the one who filed for divorce. His claimed wealth was a&nbsp;lie too, as&nbsp;he’d claimed poverty during divorce proceedings. Phone calls to&nbsp;his ex-wife and family unveiled a&nbsp;pattern of&nbsp;deceit, including fake deaths and undisclosed ex-wives. His ex-wife <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>warned</a> Reesa that Legion was a&nbsp;«<strong>master <a href=# title=manipulator data-link=tag>manipulator</a> and whatever he&nbsp;tells you is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lie</strong>.»</p><p><h2>She kicked Legion out and started the divorce process.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;smart move, Reesa decided not to&nbsp;confront her husband about her discoveries and continued investigating quietly. On&nbsp;June&nbsp;17, Legion’s birthday, Reesa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confronted</a> him about her findings. She changed the locks, disposed of&nbsp;his belongings, and prepared her divorce documents.</p><p>While Legion moved to&nbsp;Philadelphia, more information surfaced. One of&nbsp;his cousins contacted Reesa, questioning the story Legion had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> the family about his wife cheating with a&nbsp;policeman. The cousin revealed that family members Legion claimed had died had actually passed away years ago.</p><p>Reesa also spoke with Legion’s older brother, Chris, who she thought Legion talked to&nbsp;on&nbsp;the phone every morning. However, Chris hadn’t spoken to&nbsp;Legion since 2015. Legion’s twin brother also wasn’t in&nbsp;frequent contact. <strong>Coincidentally, Legion’s twin brother lived a&nbsp;life similar to&nbsp;the one Legion fabricated through lies</strong>: he&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;CEO at&nbsp;his company, drives a&nbsp;luxury car, is&nbsp;married, and resides in&nbsp;a&nbsp;four-bedroom house in&nbsp;Nashville.</p><p>Later, a&nbsp;woman Reesa thought was<strong> Legion’s aunt called, asking about their nonexistent baby</strong>. Reesa discovered that images Legion had shown her of&nbsp;his bank accounts, company car, and former house in&nbsp;San Diego were actually downloaded from the internet.</p><p><h2>Life after.</h2></p><p>Their divorce was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>finalized</a> in&nbsp;August 2021.</p><p>Reesa has experienced a&nbsp;really deep <a href=# title=trauma data-link=tag>trauma</a>, as&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confesses</a>, «I&nbsp;don’t really get excited anymore. I’m terrified to&nbsp;get excited, because&nbsp;I went through a&nbsp;whole year and some change of&nbsp;getting excited only for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;stripped away. I&nbsp;do still believe in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. I&nbsp;do still believe in&nbsp;marriage. I&nbsp;do still want that.»</p><p>While recording the series helped her find relief, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> therapy has been key, «It&nbsp;is&nbsp;still very much a&nbsp;journey of&nbsp;healing, self-reflection and simply, loving myself way more than to&nbsp;put myself through that, or&nbsp;anything even like that, ever again.»</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSwucCnqmZtYGK9or7TZquio6SkuG6%2FxKugnqtdlq%2BwwdNmn56qXaKus77Imp6eZaSkeqJ5z5qroaecpLSqr8ClZKWhkad6orrDZqWaqpOewLS10q1knJmgqba3rdOem2anppq%2Fbn2PaaRmqJWkva2xjHFocWpmaHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nft-statistics-chart-pack.html>&#171;&nbsp;15+ Pages of NFT Statistics: Demographics, Adoption in 2023</a>
