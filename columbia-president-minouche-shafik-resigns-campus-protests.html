Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the prestigious New York university grapple with protests over the Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions related to the conflict.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Ivy League school in upper Manhattan was roiled this year by student protests, culminating in scenes of police officers carrying zip ties and riot shields storming a building that had been <a href=#>occupied by pro-Palestinian protesters</a>. Similar protests swept college campuses nationwide, with many leading to violent clashes with police and thousands of arrests.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>My Writing Students Were Arrested at Columbia. Their Voices Have Never Been More Essential</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The announcement also comes just days after the school confirmed that three deans had resigned after officials said they exchanged disparaging texts during a campus discussion about Jewish life and antisemitism.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shafik was also among the university leaders called for questioning before Congress earlier this year. She was heavily criticized by Republicans who accused her of not doing enough to combat concerns about antisemitism on Columbia’s campus.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shafik announced her resignation in an emailed letter to the university community just weeks before the start of classes on Sept. 3. The university on Monday began restricting campus access to people with Columbia IDs and registered guests, saying it wanted to curb “potential disruptions” as the new semester nears.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her letter, Shafik heralded “progress in a number of important areas” but lamented that during her tenure it was “difficult to overcome divergent views across our community.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in the community,” she wrote. “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Columbia’s Relationship With Student Protesters Has Long Been Fraught</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Columbia’s Board of Trustees meanwhile announced that Katrina Armstrong, the CEO of Columbia University Irving Medical Center, will serve as interim president.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Armstrong, who is also the executive vice president for the university’s Health and Biomedical Sciences, said she was “deeply honored” to be leading the university at a “pivotal moment for Columbia.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Challenging times present both the opportunity and the responsibility for serious leadership to emerge from every group and individual within a community,” she wrote. “As I step into this role, I am acutely aware of the trials the University has faced over the past year.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pro-Palestinian protesters first set up tent encampments on Columbia’s campus during Shafik’s congressional testimony in mid-April. The school sent in police to clear the tents the following day, only for the students to return and inspire a wave of similar protests at campuses across the country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the protest rolled on for weeks, the school became a lightning rod. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson showed up to denounce the encampment, while Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came to support it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Eventually, talks between the school and the protesters came to a standstill, and as the school set a deadline for the activists to clear out, a group instead took over Hamilton Hall.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even after the protests were cleared, the school decided to <a href=#>cancel</a> its university-wide commencement ceremony, instead opting for a series of smaller, school-based ceremonies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The campus was mostly quiet this summer, but a conservative news outlet in June published images of what it said were text messages exchanged by administrators while attending the May 31 panel discussion “Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The officials were removed from their posts, with Shafik saying in a July 8 letter to the school community that the messages were unprofessional and “disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Johnson said in a statement that Shafik’s resignation was “long overdue” and should serve as a cautionary example to other university administrators that “tolerating or protecting antisemites is unacceptable and will have consequences.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other prominent Ivy League leaders have stepped down in recent months in large part due to their response to the volatile protests on campus.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill <a href=#>resigned in December</a> after less than two years on the job amid pressure from donors and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And in January, Harvard University President <a href=#>Claudine Gay resigned</a> amid plagiarism accusations and similar criticism over her testimony before Congress.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shafik said she will return to the United Kingdom to lead an effort by the foreign secretary’s office reviewing the government’s approach to international development and how to improve capability.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I am very pleased and appreciative that this will afford me the opportunity to return to work on fighting global poverty and promoting sustainable development, areas of lifelong interest to me,” she wrote. “It also enables me to return to the House of Lords to reengage with the important legislative agenda put forth by the new U.K. government.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shafik was named president of the university last year and was the first woman to take on the role, and she was one of several women newly appointed to take the reins at Ivy League institutions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Egyptian-born economist previously led the London School of Economics, but had made her mark largely outside academia with roles at the World Bank, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the time of Shafik’s appointment, Columbia Board of Trustees chair Jonathan Lavine had described her as a leader with an "unshakable confidence in the vital role institutions of higher education can and must play in solving the world’s most complex problems.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—Associated Press reporter Jake Offenhartz in New York contributed to this story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGFmfnl8jpympa2dl7aiec%2BrnKyhlJq7tXnMoqWorZOdsm6%2Fx5qdoqNdp7K0tcanqmabkaK9tr%2BMqamorJWowbR7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./canal-seine-nord-europe-feu-vert-des-hauts-de-france-au-protocole-de-financement.html>&#171;&nbsp;feu vert des Hauts-de-France au protocole de financement</a>
