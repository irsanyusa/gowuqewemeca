I also checked in with my flat-footed friends and relatives on what shoes worked best for them and grilled them on what features they liked and hated. Dr. Sutera was kind enough to share her expertise as a podiatrist and foot surgeon. I asked her a multitude of questions, and she patiently answered them. There were certain design features that I specifically looked for when searching for supportive shoes.</p><h3>Arch support</h3><p>Some shoes claim to be “supportive,” but they lack arch support. Any shoe designed for flat feet must have built-in arch support. I considered shoes with support and those whose supportive insoles could be swapped out for a custom orthotic.</p><h3>Cushioning</h3><p>When your arch touches the floor, standing and walking for long periods can be agonizing. I only chose shoes that were extremely cushioned. I picked shoes with cushioning on the metatarsal pads and a deeply cushioned midsole and innersole.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Many people with flat feet also pronate to compensate. I chose walking and running shoes designed to keep the foot aligned.</p><h3>Stability</h3><p>Another factor in the footwear chosen was the shoe’s ability to stabilize the foot. This is especially important when playing sports.</p><h3>Comfort</h3><p>No one wants squished toes or painful heels. In addition to being extremely picky about cushioning, I looked at toe box width, heel cups, and material that stretches with your movement.</p><h3>Additional issues</h3><p>If you have flat feet, you may also have plantar fasciitis, bad knees, or other foot issues. I combed through what’s on the market and found shoes that address multiple issues.</p><h3>Materials</h3><p>Whether you’re working on your feet all day, taking a jog around the park, or running errands, you want a shoe that will withstand all sorts of weather and stresses and basically not fall apart after wearing it for a few months. The shoes in this article are made with material that breathes, have been tested for wear, and are designed to last for a long time. The outsoles all have grippy treads to help stabilize the foot. They’re sturdy and durable, meant to be worn on hard surfaces like concrete, city roads, and hilly trails.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>Last, but not least, I considered how the shoe is styled. I opted for shoes for flat feet that delivered top-notch protection and served up trendy looks. For more on stylish sneakers, read our round-up on the <a rel=alternate href=#>best designer sneakers</a>.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-shoes-for-flat-feet>What to consider when buying shoes for flat feet</h2><h3>Arch support</h3><p>Flat feet need more arch support than feet with an arch. When shopping, look for shoes specifically designed for flat feet. A shoe with an arch helps to stabilize the foot, and Dr. Sutera explains that “stabilizing the arch helps block overpronation or an over-flattening of the arch.”</p><h3>Cushioning</h3><p>Dr. Sutera suggests looking for shoes with arch support and metatarsal pads. Shoes should have raised padding on the tops of the insoles, as it helps elevate and neutralize the inside of the mid-foot. Sutera says, “This is important because if the arch is abnormally flat or pronated, many problems can occur or be made worse, such as bunions, tendinitis, fasciitis, back, hip, and knee pain.” The metatarsal pads cushion and take pressure off the metatarsal joints of the forefoot.</p><h3>Shoe features for wide flat feet</h3><p>Sutera feels that those with wide, flat feet should opt for sneakers and shoes that use mesh, as they have a bit more “give” in their fabric for a more comfortable fit. She also suggests looking for sneakers that have adjustable straps, as they “can help accommodate any individual’s wide feet and potentially sensitive areas such as bunions, hammertoes, and arthritic joints.” Avoid tight shoes with a narrow cut or a pointy or stiff toe box. While they’re fashionable, they’re going to be uncomfortable to wear.</p><h3>Shoe features for flat feet that overpronate</h3><p>In addition to looking for a shoe with arch support, Sutera advises looking for shoes with deep-seated heel cups and very cushy soles. The cushion should be on top of the more rigid or contoured sole. Sutera says, “The rigid sole provides extra control, while the cushion gives comfort.” She suggests looking at sneakers and shoes from Vionic. “They have all those features in their <a rel=nofollow href=#>VIO MOTION</a> technology built into the shoes.”</p><h2 id=how-to-maintain-and-clean-shoes-for-flat-feet>How to maintain and clean shoes for flat feet</h2><p>Dr. Sutera noted that people with flat feet tend to wear down shoes faster than someone with a neutral or higher arch. Replace your shoes often, monitor for signs of wear, and look for shoes that have a durable sole.</p><p>Always follow the brand's instructions before cleaning any walking shoe or sneaker. That information can be found on a brand’s website, as an insert card in the shoe box, sometimes in a care tag on the shoe, or all three places. Some walking shoes or sneakers can be tossed into a washing machine, while others can only be spot-cleaned.</p><h2 id=what-causes-flat-feet>What causes flat feet?</h2><p>I asked New York City-based podiatrist <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jackie Sutera, DPM</a> what causes <a rel=nofollow href=#>flat feet</a>. Dr. Sutera is board-certified in foot surgery and a fellow of the American College of Foot & Ankle Surgeons. She specializes in the prevention and treatment of foot pathology. Dr. Sutera is also a member of Vionic’s Innovation Lab Experts. Dr. Sutera mentioned that flat feet can sometimes be caused by an injury, wear and tear on the foot (fallen arches), or due to some disease processes. But for the most part, flat feet are a genetic trait. If your mom, dad, or grandparents had flat feet, this is likely why your feet are flat.</p><p>A flat foot has an arch that can touch the ground, which can cause biomechanical issues and lower limb misalignment. According to Dr. Sutera, the lower limb misalignment “can also cause a misalignment to the knees, hips, and back, in addition to an abnormal gait pattern.”</p><h2 id=how-to-select-the-right-size-for-a-comfortable-fit>How to select the right size for a comfortable fit</h2><p>I asked Dr. Sutera for tips on finding the perfect fitting shoe for flat feet (I have a vested interest), and she kindly explained what to consider when shoe shopping. “Every shoe company cuts its shoes differently.” Shoe companies use a mold called a “last.” The last determines how a shoe will fit a foot. Some lasts run narrow or short, so you may need to go up or down a size when trying on shoes, depending on the brand. Sutera continued, “You may need to try different sizes and widths to see which feels and fits the best. The shoe shouldn’t feel too tight or too loose. It should be just right. Make sure there’s enough room in the toe box so that toes can lay flat.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What are flat feet?</h3><p>Flat feet are a condition in which the arch comes in contact with the ground. It can be an inherited condition or a result of work, medical issues, or accidents. When flat feet are caused by the latter, they are called fallen arches.</p><h3>What issues can flat feet cause?</h3><p>The body is misaligned, so flat feet can cause <a rel=nofollow href=#>lower back pain</a>. Dr. Sutera enumerates the other common issues caused by flat feet like “hammertoes, calluses, corns, pain, shin splints, bunions, arthritis, bone spurs, and foot instability.” She continues to explain “a rare and severe breakdown of the foot and the ‘collapse of the arch’ can be caused by a neuroarthropathy disease like diabetic <a rel=nofollow href=#>Charcot Foot</a>.”</p><h3>Do flat feet need more or less arch support?</h3><p>Dr. Sutera pointed out that flatter feet need more stability in their shoes and often benefit from more rigidity to hold up the arch. Stabilizing the arch helps block "overpronation" or over-flattening of the arch.</p><h3>Are there running shoes for flat feet?</h3><p>Just as there are walking shoes for flat feet, there are running shoes for flat feet. You’ll find a few of them mentioned in this article. Running shoes for flat feet have a few special details built into them. These features are used for comfort and support. Dr. Sutera says to look for running shoes that have arch support, more structure, and security in their shoes. She explains, “People with flat feet should look for running shoes with motion control. This helps to hold the foot in and secure it while running.” Other must-have features are deep heel cups, sturdy outsoles, and cushioned insoles.</p><h3>What sneakers do Podiatrists recommend for flat feet?</h3><p>Dr. Sutera suggests wearing <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vionic’s Walk Max Lace Up Sneaker</a>. She states,”It has cushioning balanced with support and stability. The sneaker has a lightweight midsole rebound technology to enhance your walking motion, and Super Critical Foam (Vionic's lightest midsole) is nitrogen-infused, offering the highest rebound.”</p><h3>Why should you choose shoes specifically designed for flat feet?</h3><p>Shoes designed for flat feet have arch support, stability, and cushioning. These features alleviate discomfort, prevent injury, and promote proper foot alignment. When wearing supportive shoes, walking and standing for long periods of time no longer cause discomfort.</p><h3>What type of shoes are best for men and women with flat feet?</h3><p>Shoes that provide support, stability, and comfort would benefit both men and women with flat feet. Dr. Sutera reminds you to “look for styles with deep-seated heel cups and added cushion on top of the more rigid or contoured sole. The rigid sole provides extra control, and the cushion provides comfort.”</p><h3>What shoes are best for men and women with flat feet and plantar fasciitis?</h3><p>Dr. Sutera mentions that shoes for flat feet have the same features (deep-seated heel cups, added cushioning, arch support, rigid or contoured sole) as shoes used for plantar fasciitis. She says, “Feet are the foundation of the skeleton. Supporting and stabilizing the feet helps the body from the ground up.”</p><p>Shoes for flat feet alleviate the flat arch issue by creating support under the arch, and providing additional cushioning under the metatarsal pads for continuous comfort.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lo528pr%2BMn6arZZahrrV5xZ6crWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./construire-un-projet-alimentaire-territorial-lexemple-du-douaisis-59.html>&#171;&nbsp;Construire un projet alimentaire territorial : l'exemple du Douaisis (59)</a>
