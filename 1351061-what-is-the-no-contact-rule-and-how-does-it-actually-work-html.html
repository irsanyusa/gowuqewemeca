It is effective primarily because you let yourself have space from that person and all the memories connected with them, and you allow yourself to think clearly about what is best for you.</p><h2>What is the no contact rule?</h2><p class=align-left>The no contact rule entails cutting off all communication with your ex once you break up. This means that you must not call them, text them, or reconnect in any way.</p><p class=align-left>Some versions of this rule also include restraining yourself from thinking or talking about your relationship and breakup. Instead, you distract yourself with other things, such as picking up new hobbies or doing housework.</p><p class=align-left>Many people are certain that the no contact rule is effective in healing from a breakup. Once you have moved on from obsessing over this person, you now have the chance to grow as a person and build healthier relationships in the future - whether it is with them or someone else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03126a5bec4472e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top tips on how to catch a cheater in the act and confront them</span></p></a><h2>Going no contact: How to do it?</h2><p class=align-left>The methods of cutting off communication with a former partner vary from person to person. You are the one who decides.</p><p class=align-left>Generally, it depends on how much the breakup affected you. If your partner was toxic and abusive, it is usually best to cut off all possible contact and not give yourself the chance to slip and reconcile, even if you still have feelings for them.</p><p class=align-left>The light version of getting out of touch with your ex is to just stop responding to their texts and hope that your communication dies out naturally. With time, both of you will heal and move on with your lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3581b7f0048e1600.jpg><p class=align-left>However, sometimes this is not enough - especially if you have that itch to reach out to them and go down that rabbit hole once again. There is also a chance that the person wants you back and will reach out to you when you want nothing to do with them - sometimes in a pushy and clingy way, too.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b47f4527f84ef806.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 effective ways of how to slide into DMs of your crush</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For these complex situations, there is a harsher version of the rule - blocking them on all social media, as well as all of their relatives and friends who they can use to reach you.</p><p class=align-left>Obviously, such radical steps might hurt a lot at first, but if this person was not right for you, it will be a good decision in the long run.</p><h2>How long should no contact last?</h2><p class=align-left>Usually, it should last from four to eight weeks. However, it depends on your personal situation and the relationship you had.</p><p class=align-left>If you were suffering emotional or physical abuse from your partner, it is best not to get in touch with them whatsoever, and take safety measures if they still display intentions of reconnecting with you.</p><h2>Does the no contact rule work if you were dumped?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, it does, as the lack of communication will still help you deal with the pain of being dumped.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1296b4fff1d4c0a9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best tips on how to be a good boyfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Imagine that your ex broke up with you.

They had their reasons for dumping you, and while you might want closure, you will not always get a justification for their decision.</p><p class=align-left>If your ex made a mistake and still misses you deep inside, they might need some time to understand and come to terms with it. In case they do not want anything to do with you anymore, you should learn to respect their decision, even if it is painful for you.</p><p class=align-left>After all, you do not want to be with someone who is not fully sure if they want you.

However, if you stand your ground, there is a slight chance they will eventually understand what they lost.</p><p class=align-left>Still, do not get your hopes up about reconnecting - it depends on the intensity of your breakup and whether you are truly important to them.
