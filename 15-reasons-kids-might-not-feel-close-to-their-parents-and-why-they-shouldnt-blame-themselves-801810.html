We&nbsp;say things like, “Well, she’s my&nbsp;mom,” “They’ve done everything for me&nbsp;— I&nbsp;should be&nbsp;thankful.” We&nbsp;don’t often talk about negative feelings toward our parents. However, the things they sometimes do&nbsp;may make some people feel really anxious, even when they grow&nbsp;up.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> agree with the opinions of&nbsp;<a href=#>psychologists</a> that people don’t have to&nbsp;feel close to&nbsp;their relatives, even if&nbsp;it’s their mom and dad. Today, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;compilation of&nbsp;15&nbsp;glaring examples of&nbsp;what toxic behavior in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family may lead&nbsp;to.</p><p><h2>1.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2f0/ef7/8e99345a258b3c892bdceba765.jpg><p>I like it when kids make the same thing as their parents do before</p><p>Some parents start <a href=# title=criticizing data-link=tag>criticizing</a> their children every time they feel angry, disappointed, or&nbsp;simply tired. This helps them express their negative emotions and hide their own vulnerabilities. In&nbsp;any words and actions from their children, these mothers and fathers will always <a href=#>find</a> something offensive or&nbsp;negative. Over the years, this behavior from parents doesn’t disappear and can actually get worse, and children grow up&nbsp;and don’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything good for their relatives.</p><p><h2>2.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/355/ccc/fe97ba5018b28b36c2ebbc3a95.jpg><p>I like revenges</p><p>There are parents that think that if&nbsp;their children are well-fed, and have good clothes, they are great parents. Unavailable and cold, they might be&nbsp;in&nbsp;their children’s lives physically, but not emotionally. Growing&nbsp;up, children feel that they have a&nbsp;<a href=#>duty</a> to&nbsp;their parents: to&nbsp;help them financially, to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;doctor, etc. But these parents shouldn’t expect warmth and attention from their kids.</p><p><h2>3.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/928/6de/6b81d95559b71b5ad68f2bc887.jpg><p>Narcissistic parents play a&nbsp;bigger role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s life. They are very attentive to&nbsp;how their children study, which classes they take, and what they are successful&nbsp;at. These moms and dads <a href=#>feed</a> their own egos with their children’s successes. But at&nbsp;the same time, they fail to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;unique and autonomous personality. Any mistake, any bad grade, or&nbsp;any failure at&nbsp;an&nbsp;athletic competition are the reason for an&nbsp;argument. Children feel that they are under pressure and think that they are not good enough. When these kids grow&nbsp;up, they try to&nbsp;put as&nbsp;much distance between them and their relatives in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;not repeat being under this amount of&nbsp;pressure.</p><p><h2>4.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d58/c7a/1ea9be575f9bd13d0b9fa43341.jpg><p>I like when kids copying their parents things</p><p><a href=#>Emotionally neglectful</a> mothers and fathers don’t reject their children completely, but they don’t give them a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention. When these parents become older, they realize that for some reason, their children don’t show them enough love, care, and respect. But there’s nothing surprising about that.</p><p><h2>5.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf8/1bf/9973c85d0bb53b98909c23c4f4.jpg><p>Like I said!</p><p>When parents mock their children’s interests, children feel <a href=#>ashamed</a> and this can go&nbsp;on&nbsp;for their entire lives. To&nbsp;<a href=#>protect</a> themselves from that, children may start to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same in&nbsp;response: mock their relatives’ tastes, and not value their feelings and successes enough.</p><p><h2>6.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44b/36f/1aa1ce5b4993a99cb52bf75563.jpg><p>Older parents often resort to&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular <a href=# title=manipulation data-link=tag>manipulation</a>, “We&nbsp;did everything for you and you are so&nbsp;ungrateful now!” They know that they have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;power over their children and they try to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it, even after their kids start living separately. Moms and dads can press, blackmail, and even make their children choose between them and other loved ones. In&nbsp;these situations, any choice feels like a&nbsp;betrayal. The wisest decision would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;not fall prey to&nbsp;these manipulations but <a href=#>to&nbsp;learn</a> to&nbsp;fight for your own rights, remaining grateful for everything your parents have done for you.</p><p><h2>7.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e6/a33/0545315d4b89033e5b6fd74c9f.jpg><p>There’s nothing wrong with moms and dads being ambitious about their children. But it’s bad when this becomes an&nbsp;<a href=#>obsession</a>. All the constant conversations about getting married and having children don’t make relationships between relatives any closer or&nbsp;better. The parents that do&nbsp;this shouldn’t be&nbsp;very surprised when their children stop communicating with them.</p><p><h2>8.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e8/601/c4e51b5620b21ca01b320dff71.jpg><p>Congratulations to his mom AND NOT HIS DAD HA</p><p>Psychological support from parents is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;<a href=#>important</a> for children as&nbsp;breastmilk is&nbsp;for babies. A&nbsp;psychological trauma inflicted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;relative won’t go&nbsp;away on&nbsp;its own. Some people give&nbsp;up, others become shy and scared of&nbsp;serious relationships. Others want to&nbsp;prove something to&nbsp;their relatives and achieve great successes. But still, these people feel abandoned.</p><p><h2>9.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a51/195/01313a56ae87a5ef5bbde7fe6e.jpg><p>Don't trust your parents a lot when telling secrets</p><p>Trusting a&nbsp;secret to&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big step for a&nbsp;child. This is&nbsp;both a&nbsp;test of&nbsp;authority and a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;support friendship. But if&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent laughs or&nbsp;gets angry instead of&nbsp;keeping the secret, and then also tells everyone about&nbsp;it, the trust in&nbsp;this family will be&nbsp;lost forever. Very often it&nbsp;makes children not want to&nbsp;tell their parents about anything at&nbsp;all.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;stopped trusting my&nbsp;mother at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;7&nbsp;when&nbsp;I told her&nbsp;I liked a&nbsp;boy in&nbsp;my&nbsp;class and by&nbsp;the next morning, all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;relatives knew about&nbsp;it... I&nbsp;know it’s not that serious, but this story put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;my&nbsp;trust. Now, my&nbsp;mom is&nbsp;always complaining that I’m very secretive and that&nbsp;I haven’t told her anything in&nbsp;21&nbsp;years! And when&nbsp;I tell her the reason why&nbsp;I don’t share anything with her, she doesn’t believe&nbsp;me! <a href=#>©&nbsp;nfh354410&nbsp;/ Pikabu</a></li></ul><p><h2>10.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80c/614/b8f87b57b9889c128bfb6b9ee8.jpg><p>Nice revenge son</p><p>“Why are you crying like a&nbsp;baby?” “Look! Everyone is&nbsp;looking and laughing at&nbsp;you!” “You’re not beautiful when you’re crying, stop it&nbsp;now!”&nbsp;— many parents are convinced that shaming their children for crying is&nbsp;the only way to&nbsp;stop them from crying. But the only thing this reaction can lead to&nbsp;is&nbsp;making children reserved and shy. Crying when you are hurt is&nbsp;<a href=#>normal</a>. Kids need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;deal with unpleasant emotions.</p><p><h2>11.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d36/6fe/89a18a5eb487993f370f3dcc4b.jpg><p>Let the kid choose his own ambition</p><p>Parents who are obsessed with power think that they have a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;know what profession their children should choose, who they should date and marry, and what job they should choose. And they don’t care that their kids are not babies anymore, or&nbsp;that they are adults that can make their own decisions. The control is&nbsp;<a href=#>irrational</a>. And the parents’ argument&nbsp;is, “Because I&nbsp;said&nbsp;so.” The children that remain under their parents’ control have a&nbsp;very hard time later. They not only have this anger in&nbsp;their souls, but they also learn to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;other people’s wishes, believing that someone else’s needs are more important than their own.</p><p><h2>12.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9c/c03/8a835d557d9074540f81c3a259.jpg><p>Don't always blame the oldest</p><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very frequent situation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family where one of&nbsp;the children is&nbsp;loved more. For example, the older child is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;perform the duties of&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, and he&nbsp;or&nbsp;she is&nbsp;told off for every little thing, whereas the younger child gets away with everything. And the older child may be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;set an&nbsp;example for the younger child. If&nbsp;parents don’t notice this problem, it&nbsp;makes the conflict between the siblings very <a href=#>serious</a>.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;I was 9&nbsp;in&nbsp;1996. I’m the oldest child. Someone on&nbsp;TV said that younger children are loved more. My&nbsp;dad says to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom, “Well, it’s true, isn’t it?! I&nbsp;wonder why this&nbsp;is...” My&nbsp;mom agreed.

So, they are very <a href=#>harsh</a> with their kids. Parents set standards that children are not able to&nbsp;reach and then they are surprised when their kids grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very shy.</p><p><h2>14.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b3/100/cd1251558a835d547ada2d6e0c.jpg><p>It's not her fault.

They often say something like, “If&nbsp;it&nbsp;hadn’t been for you, my&nbsp;life would have been very different.” These words are very painful to&nbsp;hear. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fight the feeling of&nbsp;guilt, you need to&nbsp;draw the line and not let yourself be&nbsp;manipulated. It’s not the child’s decision to&nbsp;be&nbsp;born.</p><p><h2>15.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d70/8e6/3bd4545497aa4bfa50cea5de74.jpg><p>Then they worry about why they kids are not talking to them anymore!</p><p>“What will people say?” “Everyone knows me&nbsp;in&nbsp;this town.

They want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;<a href=#>perfect</a> that they don’t have time for anything else.
